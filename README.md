# Kitchen-Chaos

A Unity practice project built from scratch that simulates Overcooked. Credits to [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg) for the amazing assets and tutorial.

Some implementation improvements:
- The cutting and cooking progress will not be reset when the ingredients are taken away from the counters, which is more realistic
- Duplicates of the same ingredients are allowed in a recipe, which allows for greater flexibility in the future
- There can be multiple delivery counters in the same game scene
